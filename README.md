# dotfiles

My dotfiles, a collection of self-written and self-copied scripts and config files.
I did not spend any time making them particularly portable (or particularly well-documented) -
some things may require certain packages to be installed,
some things may be Arch-specific or at least systemd-specific
but overall most of it should be applicable to any Linux distro and even macOS,
perhaps with minor modifications.

There are some git submodules in here that need to be cloned.

There is also an install script that can copy the files to the user home directory,
and additionally copy system-wide configuration with `-a`.
